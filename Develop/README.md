# Express Note Taker
     

## Description


This project showcases backend routes to allow a front end application to work as intended. This application allows the user to add, save, and delete notes with the click of a button. Information is saved on page refresh and is available until deleted. The project helped me understand the basics of how server routing works and how to tie the front end of the application to the back end server using middleware and routes. Modules used were Node, FS, Express, path, and uniqid. The most challenging aspect of the project was trying to debug a major error in my pathing. I accidentally put files in the wrong folder and they were not able to communicate, causing syntax errors.
